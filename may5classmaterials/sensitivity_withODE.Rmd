# Sensitivity Analysis of a differential equation 

We can apply sensitivity analysis to a differential equation

A key issue where is sensitivity of what?

Dyanmics models often give you many many outputs - time series (streamflow every day for a year, popultation for 30 years) - or output over space (concentration every 10 meters)

So if we are asking 'sensitivity of what' we need to summarize results in some way (reduce their dimensionality )

Ideas?


Depends on what is important for your model application

* max

* mean

* min

* total

* variation

So a key step in sensitivity analysis with a dynamics model is summarizing results into a few key measures

Its useful to turn that summarizing activiity into a function


## Workflow

* obtain parameter sets (from sobel of LHS)

* build a function that will extract the information (metrics) you want from your dynamics model (output of the ode)

* create a data structure to store the metrics for each parameter set - lets call it metrics (but could be anything)

* run ODE for each parameter sets to fill in this metrics data structure

* send the metrics data structure back to the sensitivity analysis object (from sobel or LHS)

* plot and analyze results
```{r sen}
source("../R/dexppop_play.R")

# lets start with sobel 
library(sensitivity)

# come up with first set of sample parameters
# we will assume that we know the initial population,

Pinitial=10

# want to learn about sensitivity to growth rate (r) and carrying capacity (K)
# set the number of parameters
np=100
K = rnorm(mean=400, sd=10, n=np)
r = rnorm(mean=0.02, sd=0.005, n=np)
X1 = cbind.data.frame(r=r, K=K)

# repeat to get our second set of samples
K = rnorm(mean=400, sd=20, n=np)
r = rnorm(mean=0.02, sd=0.005, n=np)
X2 = cbind.data.frame(r=r, K=K)

# create our sobel object and get sets ofparameters for running the model

sens_P = soboljansen(model = NULL,X1, X2, nboot = 300)

# our parameter sets are
head(sens_P$X)

# run our differential equation and keep the output
# BUT
# what output do we want  to keep
# how about maximum population if we run the model for 200 years, and how many years to get to the carrying capacity

# for illustration lets look at running just one parameter sets and summarizing results
sens_P$X[1,]
# recall ODE needs ALL of our parameters in a single list 
# initial population and timnes for which we want output 
Pinitial

# gets results for 200 years (evaluating every year)
simtimes = seq(from=1, to=200)
parms = list(r=sens_P$X$r[1], K=sens_P$X$K[1])
result = ode(y=Pinitial, times=simtimes, func=dexppop_play, parms=parms)

head(result)
colnames(result)=c("time","P")
# turn it into a data frame
result = as.data.frame(result)
ggplot(result, aes(time, P))+geom_point()

# extra our metrics of interest  from this
# maximum population it gets to
maxpop = max(result$P)
maxpop

# years required to get to the maximum poputation
# which.max will tell us when max population occur
idx = which.max(result$P)
# turn this index into a year (might be the same if time step in 1 but just in case it isn't)
maxyear = result$time[idx]
maxyear
```

What if we want to run for all parameters

Lets create two additional functions that will help us

* a function that computes the metrics we want

* a function that runs our ode solver and computes the metrics (I call it a wrapper function as it is really just a workflow/wrapper to call ode solver and then compute metrics)
```{r sen2}
# turn computing our metrics into a function

compute_metrics = function(result) {
  maxpop = max(result$P)
idx = which.max(result$P)
maxyear = result$time[idx]
return(list(maxpop=maxpop, maxyear=maxyear))}

# try it on our first parameter set
compute_metrics(result)

# great but we need to apply the ode and this function for all of our parameters



# define a wrapper function to do everything we need - run solver and compute metrics - and send back results for each parameter

p_wrapper = function(r,K, Pinitial, simtimes, func) {
    parms = list(r=r, K=K)
    result = ode(y=Pinitial, times=simtimes, func=func, parms=parms) 
    colnames(result)=c("time","P")
  # get metrics
  metrics=compute_metrics(as.data.frame(result))
  return(metrics)
}

# now use pmap as we did before

allresults = sens_P$X %>% pmap(p_wrapper, Pinitial=Pinitial, simtimes=simtimes, func=dexppop_play)

# extract out results from pmap into a data frame
allres = allresults %>% map_dfr(`[`,c("maxpop","maxyear"))


# create boxplots
tmp = allres %>% gather(key="metric", value="value")
ggplot(tmp, aes(metric, value, col=metric))+geom_boxplot()
```

Compute the sobol indicies for each metric

```{r sen3}
# sobol can only handle one output at a time  - so we will need to do them separately

sens_P_maxpop = sensitivity::tell(sens_P,allres$maxpop)

# first-order indices (main effect without co-variance)
sens_P_maxpop$S

# total sensitivity index -note that this partitions the output variance - so values sum to 1
sens_P_maxpop$T

plot(sens_P_maxpop)


# create another one for max year
sens_P_maxyear = sensitivity::tell(sens_P,allres$maxyear)
# first-order indices (main effect without co-variance)
sens_P_maxyear$S

# total sensitivity index -note that this partitions the output variance - so values sum to 1
sens_P_maxyear$T

# notice how K is much more imprtant here
plot(sens_P_maxyear)


```

Consider the following model of forest growth (where forest size in measured in units of carbon (C))



dC/dt  = r*C for forests where carbon is below a canopy closure threshold 



dC/dt = g  for forests where carbon is  at or above the threshold canopy closure



dC/dt = 0 once a carrying capacity (K) is reached.







The size of the forest (C), Canopy closure threshold and carrying capacity are all in units of carbon 



You could think of the canopy closure threshold as the size of the forest at which growth rates change from exponential to linear



You can think of r, as early exponential growth rate and g as the linear growth rate once canopy closure has been reached

Here's what you will do



1. Implement this model in R (as a differential equation)



2. Run the model for 300 years (using the ODE solver)  starting with an initial forest size of 10 kg/C, and using the following parameters



canopy closure threshold of 50 kgC 



 K = 250 kg C (carrying capacity) 



 r=  0.01 (exponential growth rate before before canopy closure)



 g = 2 kg/year (linear growth rate after canopy closure)



Graph the results



3. Run a sobol sensitivity analysis that explores how the estimated maximum and mean forest size (e.g maximum and mean values of C over the 300 years) varies with the pre canopy closure growth rate (r) and post-canopy closure growth rate (g) and canopy closure threshold and carrying capacity(K)

Assume that they are all normally distributed with means as given above and standard deviation of 10% of mean value

Graph the results of the sensitivity analysis as a box plot of maximum forest size and a plot of the two sobol indices (S and T)
