## Difference Equations

Population models can be discrete (rather than continuous)
So we could implement them as difference equations and iterate
like we did with diffusion

```{r iteratie}
source("../R/discrete_logistic_pop.R")
# notice how a for loop is used to iterate

# how many rabbits after 50 years given a growth of 0.1
# starting with 1 rabbit - but a carrying capcity of 500



discrete_logistic_pop(P0=1, r=0.05, K=200, T=50)

# save results
discrete_result = discrete_logistic_pop(P0=1, r=0.05, K=200, T=50)

# lets also keep the parameters for use later
P0=1
r=0.05
K=200
T=50

```

## Differential Equation comparison

Remember we have 3 ways now to calculate population

analytical solution - based on integration (exppop.R) BEST

using an ode solver for numerical approximation (exppop_play.R)

numerical integration using in discrete steps (discrete_logistic_pop.R)
```{r closed}

source("../R/exppop.R")

exppop(P0=P0, r=r, K=K, T=T)
analytic_result = exppop(P0=P0, r=r, K=K, T=T)

analytic_result
discrete_result

# why are they different
# look at trajectories

growth_result = data.frame(time=seq(from=1,to=100))

growth_result$Panalytic = growth_result$time %>% map_dbl(~exppop( P0=1,r=0.05, K=200,T=.x ))

growth_result$Pdiscrete = growth_result$time %>% map_dbl(~discrete_logistic_pop( P0=1,r=0.05, K=200,T=.x ))

tmp = growth_result %>% gather(key="Ptype",value="P",-time)
ggplot(tmp, aes(time,P, col=Ptype))+geom_point()

# try running them for longer time periods to see what happens 
# change the value of r, K , P0 - see how it effects the results
```

Finally look at continuous derivative using ODE solve
Needs
*initial condtions
*differential equation
*parameters

```{r}

source("../R/dexppop_play.R")

# set up using the same parameters
pcompare = list(r=r,K=K)


# now run our ODE solver
result = ode(P0, growth_result$time, dexppop_play, pcompare)
head(result)

# we already have time - so just extract population
growth_result$Pdifferential = result[,2]

# comapre all 3 approaches
tmp = growth_result %>% gather(key="Ptype",value="P",-time)
ggplot(tmp, aes(time,P, col=Ptype))+geom_point()

# notice Pderiv is closer to Pa
```

All differential and difference equations are approximations
The analytical solution is exact

Notice that differential equations is a bit more accurate!
